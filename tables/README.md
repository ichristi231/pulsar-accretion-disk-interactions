# Tables

This directory contains tables needed to compare the non-thermal emission from pulsar-disk interactions with that of Sgr A* observations. Currently, this directory contains the log10 values of:

i) the photon frequency (in Hz) of observations 

ii) the respective luminosity (in erg/s) of Sgr A*

## Observations & Citations

The frequency ranges of Sgr A*'s observations and their respective references are listed below:

i) radio frequencies (`1.36 - 235.6 GHz`) we adopted from:
