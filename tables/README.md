# Tables

This directory contains tables needed to compare the non-thermal emission from pulsar-disk interactions with that of Sgr A* observations. Currently, this directory contains the log10 values of:

i) the photon frequency (in Hz) of observations 

ii) the respective luminosity (in erg/s) of Sgr A*

iii) spin-down luminosities (in erg/s) of pulsars taken from the ATNF survery [[1][1]]

## Observations

The frequency ranges of Sgr A*'s observations and their respective references are listed below:

i) radio frequencies (`1.36 - 235.6 GHz`) were adopted from:

(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...499..731F/abstract)

ii) x-ray frequencies (`2 - 10 keV`) were adopted from:

Baganoff F. K. et al., 2003, Astrophysical Journal, 591, 891
(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...591..891B/abstract)

iii) NIR to IR frequencies (`1 - 30 micro-meters`) were adopted from:
